MoonWolf â€” recorded live at Frigjort Festival 2025 in Christiania â€” puts you right in the heart of Tromleorkestretâ€™s fire-breathing, steampunk-inspired music machine. 

Shot with an Insta360 X5 mounted directly on the machine, this unique angle captures the hypnotic performance, the robotic instruments, the flames, the lights, and the incredible energy of the crowd. ðŸŽµ About Tromleorkestret: We are a Danish ensemble creating psychedelic, cinematic soundscapes with a self-built, robotic music machine.
