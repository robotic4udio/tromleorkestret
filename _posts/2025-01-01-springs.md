At the heart of Tromleorkestret’s Music Machine lies **The Springs**, a percussive instrument that transforms industrial remnants into a vibrant musical centerpiece. Built from salvaged springs sourced from automotive and other industries, The Springs combines tactile performance with innovative sound design, creating rhythmic and resonant textures that are both mechanical and magical.

### **Key Features and Design**

1. **Springs as Musical Elements**
    - Each spring in the instrument is mounted directly to the Music Machine and serves as a playable surface. Striking a spring triggers a sound sample or synthesized tone, making it a highly versatile performance sampler and synth. The synthetic sound can be modulated by the resonance of the spring, creating a unique blend of physical and digital tones.
    - **Evolving Sound Palette**: The instrument allows for dynamic sound swapping during performances, enabling the tonal palette of each spring to shift in real time, adding depth and variability to compositions.
2. **Spring Resonance**
    - A pair of **contact microphones** are strategically placed to capture the natural vibrations of all the springs. This raw, organic resonance is processed through a DSP effects chain, and can also be used as a modulator for the synthetic sound to create rich, layered sounds.
    - The interplay between the physical resonance and digital processing gives **The Springs** its unique sonic identity, where raw industrial tones meet modern synthesis.
3. **Illuminated Performance**
    - Each spring is paired with a **glow-lamp bulb** that blinks as the spring is struck, creating a stunning visual effect. These rhythmic bursts of light synchronize with the music, adding an enchanting layer of motion and illumination to the performance.
4. **Dual Audio Systems**
    - **Bela-Based System**: The Springs operates through a **Bela.io** embedded platform running custom C++ code, delivering precise, real-time sound manipulation and DSP processing tailored to Tromleorkestret’s needs.
    - **Max for Live System**: The system connects to a **Max4Live device** in Ableton Live, offering entirely distinct sonic possibilities and remapping the instrument’s behavior for experimental and dynamic soundscapes.

    - These two systems function independently, providing The Springs with a diverse range of expressive capabilities.

### **Performance and Visual Appeal**

1. **Percussive Power**
    - The Springs bring a powerful rhythmic element to Tromleorkestret’s music, with percussive strikes that range from sharp, metallic hits to warm, resonant tones. The ability to reconfigure the sound palette mid-performance ensures a constantly evolving musical texture.
2. **Mesmerizing Visuals**
    - The combination of vibrating springs and glowing bulbs creates a hypnotic visual spectacle. Each strike sets a spring into motion while its paired bulb pulses with light, captivating the audience and adding a theatrical flourish to the Music Machine’s performance.
    - Occasionally some of the springs trigger a fire burst from the Flamethrower mounted in the machine, adding a dramatic visual element to the performance. 
    - The springs can also trigger changes in the light setup on the machine, creating a synchronized audio-visual experience.

<em>Only sound from the Springs</em></p>

**The Springs** embody Tromleorkestret’s unique ability to repurpose industrial materials into musical marvels. Layered soundscapes, dynamic tonal adaptability, and captivating visual design make them an integral part of the Music Machine. Whether producing raw industrial rhythms or shimmering synthesized textures, The Springs add an unmistakable energy and magic to Tromleorkestret’s performances, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary.






Sequencer & Randomization Experimentation. I have updated the sampler for the springs with more sequencer and randomization options. Here I’m trying to make some creapy sounds for an upcomming Science and Cocktails podcast about Crispr @scienceandcocktailsglobal
