> "Hearing the Aeolynth felt like stepping into a dream where sound and motion were one."

The **Aeolynth** is a synthetic wind instrument, crafted to deliver an unparalleled combination of expressivity, technological innovation, and versatility. Designed as part of Tromleorkestret’s unique ensemble, it stands as a testament to the seamless fusion of handcrafted materials and cutting-edge technology.

The name “Aeolynth” combines “Aeolus,” the Greek god of wind, with “synth,” emphasizing its synthetic origins. It evokes a sense of grandeur and mythological power, perfectly fitting for a custom wind instrument capable of producing epic, awe-inspiring sounds.
#### **Key Components and Functionality**
1. **Capacitive Touch Key System**
    - **Design**: The **Aeolynth** features three octaves of capacitive touch buttons made from furniture nails, chosen for their tactile feel and visual appeal.
    - **Technology**: These keys are powered by **MPR101 capacitive touch sensors**, ensuring precise and responsive input detection.
    - **Chord Capabilities**: Unlike traditional wind instruments, the Aeolynth allows for **chord playing**, enabling the performer to produce rich harmonies and explore musical possibilities that are typically unattainable in similar instruments.
2. **Mouthpiece with Pressure Sensor**
    - **Component**: A salvaged clarinet mouthpiece fitted with an **Adafruit MPRLS Breakout** pressure sensor captures the breath intensity of the performer.
    - **Expressive Dynamics**: The pressure input controls parameters such as volume, attack, and timbre, allowing nuanced musical phrasing.
3. **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**
    - **Component**: The instrument integrates an [Adafruit BNO055 IMU](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4646) sensor, capable of detecting roll, pitch, and yaw.
    - **Dynamic Modulation**: These motion-based inputs enable expressive control over effects like vibrato, glissando, or spatial audio manipulation, adding an interactive and immersive dimension to performances.
4. **Microcontroller Unit (MCU)**
    - **Component**: The **Adafruit ESP32-S3 FEATHER 4MB/2MB PSRAM** microcontroller serves as the brain of the Aeolynth, processing inputs from the keys, pressure sensor, and IMU.
    - **Communication Protocol**: Data is transmitted using **Open Sound Control (OSC)**, ensuring high-speed, low-latency communication with external audio systems.
5. **Sound Engine and Audio Processing**
    - **Custom Engine**: Tromleorkestret employs a proprietary sound engine, developed in **C++**, to process and generate audio from the Aeolynth’s inputs. This engine is tailored to support the unique characteristics of their instruments.
    - **Embedded Solutions**: **Bela** platforms are used to deliver high-quality, real-time audio processing across the ensemble’s instruments, ensuring flawless integration with the Aeolynth.
    - **MaxMSP Integration**: The team also utilizes **MaxMSP** for specific audio applications, combining the best of custom programming and graphical tools.
6. **Commercial Software Synergy**
    - Tromleorkestret strategically integrates **industry-leading audio software** when appropriate to achieve optimal results, balancing custom development with proven commercial solutions.

#### **Innovative Performance Capabilities**
One of the Aeolynth’s most groundbreaking features is its ability to play **chords**. This capability transforms the instrument into a harmonic powerhouse, enabling the performer to layer rich textures and create orchestral-like arrangements. Combined with its expressive breath control, motion-sensing capabilities, and the ability to interface seamlessly with both custom and commercial audio systems, the Aeolynth pushes the boundaries of what a wind instrument can achieve.

#### **Conclusion**
The Aeolynth is a revolutionary step forward in wind instrument design, offering unparalleled versatility and expressivity. Its chord-playing capability, combined with dynamic control and cutting-edge technology, makes it a centerpiece of Tromleorkestret’s innovative musical vision, capable of delivering performances that are as extraordinary as the instrument itself.
