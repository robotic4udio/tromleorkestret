The **Autonomous Xylophone** is a simple yet enchanting addition to the Music Machine. Fitted with solenoid actuators—one for each tine—it plays autonomously, striking precise notes to add a layer of magic to the sound.

Its bright, chiming tones evoke the charm of a mechanical music box, bringing a sense of wonder and delight to the compositions. Controlled via **Open Sound Control (OSC)**, the xylophone integrates seamlessly with the other instruments, enhancing the machine’s cohesive performance.
