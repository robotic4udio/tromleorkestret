Hi, my name is Hjalte Bested Hjorth. I am a composer, musician, and creative technologist with a passion for blending art, music, and technology to create immersive, one-of-a-kind experiences. My work is driven by a love for crafting soundscapes that defy genres and inspire wonder, as well as a hands-on approach to building and coding the tools that make these creations possible.

As a composer, I explore a broad spectrum of styles, from cinematic and experimental electronic music to dynamic, interactive performances. My music often combines human expression with mechanical precision, showcasing custom-built instruments like the fire-breathing music machine of **Tromleorkestret**. Rooted in creativity and experimentation, my compositions are inspired by everything from psychedelic journeys and film scores to the rich interplay of acoustic and electronic sound.  

Iâ€™m also a DIY enthusiast and creative coder who thrives on turning bold concepts into tangible creations. With a background in robotics and engineering, I design and build robotic instruments, sensor-driven interfaces, and interactive installations. My projects seamlessly combine custom hardware, creative algorithms, and programming to blur the lines between musician and machine. Tools like Bela, MaxMSP, and Open Sound Control (OSC) play a central role in my work, allowing me to shape performances that are as visually captivating as they are sonically innovative.  

As the creator of Tromleorkestret, I have developed a performance style where human musicians and robotic instruments share the stage in a spectacle of sound, light, and motion. This blend of artistry and engineering reflects my lifelong fascination with pushing the boundaries of what music and technology can achieve together.

Whether composing for theater, designing interactive learning tools, or performing on stage, my goal is always the same: to connect, inspire, and transport audiences to new realms of creativity and imagination.
