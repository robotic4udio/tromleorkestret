We are Tromleorkestret, a Danish ensemble that brings together music, technology, and performance art to create immersive, genre-defying experiences. At the heart of what we do is our custom-built, fire-breathing music machine—a steampunk-inspired creation where human creativity and mechanical ingenuity collide.

Our sound is a kaleidoscope of styles, blending cinematic orchestration, krautrock, experimental EDM, and more. Each performance is an adventure, combining robotic precision with human artistry to craft soundscapes that are both otherworldly and deeply emotive. We love exploring the space where chaos meets harmony, where the mechanical becomes magical.

What makes Tromleorkestret truly unique is our music machine. Every instrument we play is handcrafted and full of surprises, from the Robotic Slide Bass to the Aeolynth, the Sound Gloves, and the Autonomous Xylophone. These instruments are more than tools—they’re collaborators, driven by custom-built technology and designed to respond to motion, touch, and sound in real-time. Together, we turn every performance into a dynamic interplay between human and machine.


But Tromleorkestret is about more than just the music. Our performances are a feast for the senses—flames that light up the night, lights that pulse with the beat, and a stage full of moving parts that bring our vision to life. Inspired by steampunk aesthetics, cabaret, and a love for the absurd, we aim to transport our audiences to a world where anything is possible.

For us, Tromleorkestret is more than a band. It’s a playground for invention, a celebration of creativity, and a way to explore the boundaries of art and technology. We want to amaze, inspire, and leave you with a spark of wonder that stays long after the show ends.

Welcome to our world—where music, fire, and invention come together in perfect chaos.

# The People

## ABOUT HJALTE BESTED HJORTH

Hi, my name is Hjalte Bested Hjorth. I am a composer, musician, and creative technologist with a passion for blending art, music, and technology to create immersive, one-of-a-kind experiences. My work is driven by a love for crafting soundscapes that defy genres and inspire wonder, as well as a hands-on approach to building and coding the tools that make these creations possible.

As a composer, I explore a broad spectrum of styles, from cinematic and experimental electronic music to dynamic, interactive performances. My music often combines human expression with mechanical precision, showcasing custom-built instruments like the fire-breathing music machine of **Tromleorkestret**. Rooted in creativity and experimentation, my compositions are inspired by everything from psychedelic journeys and film scores to the rich interplay of acoustic and electronic sound.

I’m also a DIY enthusiast and creative coder who thrives on turning bold concepts into tangible creations. With a background in robotics and engineering, I design and build robotic instruments, sensor-driven interfaces, and interactive installations. My projects seamlessly combine custom hardware, creative algorithms, and programming to blur the lines between musician and machine. Tools like Bela, MaxMSP, and Open Sound Control (OSC) play a central role in my work, allowing me to shape performances that are as visually captivating as they are sonically innovative.

As the creator of Tromleorkestret, I have developed a performance style where human musicians and robotic instruments share the stage in a spectacle of sound, light, and motion. This blend of artistry and engineering reflects my lifelong fascination with pushing the boundaries of what music and technology can achieve together.
  
Whether composing for theater, designing interactive learning tools, or performing on stage, my goal is always the same: to connect, inspire, and transport audiences to new realms of creativity and imagination.
