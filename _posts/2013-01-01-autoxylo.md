The **Autonomous Xylophone** is a simple yet enchanting addition to Tromleorkestret’s Music Machine. Fitted with solenoid actuators—one for each tine—it plays autonomously, striking precise notes to add a layer of magic to the ensemble’s sound.

Its bright, chiming tones evoke the charm of a mechanical music box, bringing a sense of wonder and delight to the compositions. Controlled via **Open Sound Control (OSC)**, the xylophone integrates seamlessly with the other instruments, enhancing the machine’s cohesive performance.

Though modest in complexity, the Autonomous Xylophone’s melodic clarity and whimsical character make it an essential part of Tromleorkestret’s unique musical identity.
